Welcome to CR7 Memory Game, a creative project designed and developed by Michal, Nik, and Lucy!

## Overview

CR7 Memory Game is an engaging web application that challenges players to exercise their memory skills by flipping cards and matching them. The objective is to find all the matching pairs with as few turns as possible. Once victorious, players can etch their name onto the leaderboard by submitting their username along with their score.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End Development:** HTML and CSS were utilized to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Media queries ensure the game functions seamlessly across various screen sizes, while CSS animations enhance the overall experience.
- **Interactivity:** Dynamic content is achieved through vanilla JavaScript, enabling smooth DOM manipulation. Event listeners allows users to interact with the game effortlessly.
- **Back-End Development:** The server-side is powered by Express.js, facilitating seamless communication with a SQLite database. This ensures efficient handling of HTTP requests and data management.
- **Database Integration:** SQLite was chosen for its efficiency in storing, updating, and retrieving data using SQL queries. The integration of the **better-sqlite3** library enables asynchronous database operations, enhancing performance.

## Design and Planning

- **Figjam:** We meticulously planned our project using Figjam, which included wireframes, user journeys, user stories, and a detailed code plan. This laid a solid foundation for development.
- **Trello:** Task management was streamlined using Trello boards. Tasks were categorized, assigned, and tracked efficiently, with urgent tasks highlighted in red for immediate attention. Daily stand-ups ensured everyone was aligned and progress remained on track.

## Collaboration

- **Communication:** Daily Google Meet sessions provided a platform for debugging, planning, and mutual assistance with code and GitHub. Discord served as a hub for sharing links and exchanging ideas, fostering a collaborative environment.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub were instrumental in facilitating collaborative coding. The shared repository, branching strategy, and pull request workflow enabled seamless collaboration while ensuring code integrity. Conflict resolution and merging were handled to maintain a stable codebase.

We're excited to present CR7 Memory Game‚Äîa testament to our collective effort and passion for creating engaging web experiences. Join the fun and see if you can top the leaderboard! üèÜ
